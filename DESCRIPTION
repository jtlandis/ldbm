Description: Simple package to track data that is stored locally. The project aims to hold information about each data set that one would normally need to classify in a formal database, such as column names and data types, key columns, data dimensions, size and location on disk. The package was orginally made with the intentions to eventually make a local shiny database gui - but having mutliple users read and write to the same physical file may prove difficult.
